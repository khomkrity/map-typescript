TypeScript inherits major pros of JavaScript, but also offers additional benefits coming from static typing and other concepts specific to TS.

They prove especially useful when it comes to large-sized codebase and distributed teams working on the same project.

- **Static Typing**: The compiler alerts developers to type-related mistakes, so they have no opportunity to hit the production phase.
- **OOP**: TypeScript supports object oriented programming concept which facilitates building a well-organized, resuable, and scalable code
